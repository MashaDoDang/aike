# T-Shirt Demand Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the demand for t-shirts based on various features such as material, color, size, and sleeve length. The application uses machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers, to make predictions. The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding, standardization, and normalization. The performance of the models is evaluated using different hyperparameters and data transformations.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - One-Hot Encoding for categorical features like material and color.
  - Ordinal Encoding for ordered categorical features like size, sleeves, and demand.
  - Standardization and normalization of feature sets.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: 
  - Implementation of Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers.
  - Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
  - Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: 
  - Plots of standardized and normalized feature sets for better understanding of data distribution.
